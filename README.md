Cryptarithmetic Problem is a type of constraint satisfaction problem where the game is about digits and its unique replacement either with alphabets or other symbols. In cryptarithmetic problem, the digits  (0-9) get substituted by some possible alphabets or symbols. The task in cryptarithmetic problem is to substitute each digit with an alphabet to get the result arithmetically correct.
